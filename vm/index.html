	View source is a feature, not a bug. Thanks for your curiosity and
	interest in participating!

	Here are the submission guidelines for the new and improved csszengarden.com:

	- CSS3? Of course! Prefix for ALL browsers where necessary.
	- go responsive; test your layout at multiple screen sizes.
	- your browser testing baseline: IE9+, recent Chrome/Firefox/Safari, and iOS/Android
	- Graceful degradation is acceptable, and in fact highly encouraged.
	- use classes for styling. Don't use ids.
	- web fonts are cool, just make sure you have a license to share the files. Hosted 
	  services that are applied via the CSS file (ie. Google Fonts) will work fine, but
	  most that require custom HTML won't. TypeKit is supported, see the readme on this
	  page for usage instructions: https://github.com/mezzoblue/csszengarden.com/

	And a few tips on building your CSS file:

	- use :first-child, :last-child and :nth-child to get at non-classed elements
	- use ::before and ::after to create pseudo-elements for extra styling
	- use multiple background images to apply as many as you need to any element
	- use the Kellum Method for image replacement, if still needed. http://goo.gl/GXxdI
	- don't rely on the extra divs at the bottom. Use ::before and ::after instead.

			<h2>What is new</h2>
		</header>
			<p>Jewish tradition
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Seth figures in the Life of Adam and Eve, also known in its Greek version as the Apocalypse of Moses, a Jewish pseudepigraphical group of writings. It recounts the lives of Adam and Eve from after their expulsion from the Garden of Eden to their deaths. The surviving versions were composed from the early 3rd to the 5th century, the literary units in the work are considered to be older and predominantly of Jewish origin. There is wide agreement that the original was composed in a Semitic language in the 1st century AD/CE.:252 In the Greek versions Seth and Eve travel to the doors of the Garden to beg for some oil of the tree of mercy (i.e. the Tree of Life). On the way Seth is attacked and bitten by a wild beast, which goes away when ordered by Seth. Michael refuses to give them the oil at that time, but promises to give it at the end of time, when all flesh will be raised up, the delights of paradise will be given to the holy people and God will be in their midst. On their return, Adam says to Eve: "What hast thou done? Thou hast brought upon us great wrath which is death." (chapters 5–14) Later only Seth can witness the taking-up of Adam at his funeral in a divine chariot, which deposits him in the Garden of Eden.</p>

			<h3>In gnosticism, Seth is seen as a replacement given by God for Abel, whom Cain had slain. It is said that late in life, Adam gave Seth secret teachings that would become the kabbalah. The Zohar refers to Seth as "ancestor of all the generations of the tzaddikim" (Hebrew: righteous ones)</h3>
			<p>According to Josephus</p>
			</br>
				<p>	In the Antiquities of the Jews, Josephus refers to Seth as virtuous and of excellent character, and reports that his descendants invented the wisdom of the heavenly bodies, and built the "pillars of the sons of Seth", two pillars inscribed with many scientific discoveries and inventions, notably in astronomy. They were built by Seth's descendants based on Adam's prediction that the world would be destroyed at one time by fire and another time by global flood, in order to protect the discoveries and be remembered after the destruction. One was composed of brick, and the other of stone, so that if the pillar of brick should be destroyed, the pillar of stone would remain, both reporting the ancient discoveries, and informing men that a pillar of brick was also erected. Josephus reports that the pillar of stone remained in the land of Siriad in his day.
					William Whiston, a 17/18th century translator of the Antiquities, stated in a footnote that he believed Josephus mistook Seth for Sesostris, king of Egypt, the erector of the pillar in Siriad (being a contemporary name for the territories in which Sirius was venerated (i.e., Egypt). He stated that there was no way for any pillars of Seth to survive the deluge, because the deluge buried all such pillars and edifices far underground in the sediment of its waters. The Perennialist writer Nigel Jackson identifies the land of Siriad in Josephus' account with Syria, citing related Mandaean legends regarding the 'Oriental Land of Shyr' in connection with the visionary mytho-geography of the prophetic traditions surrounding Seth.</p>
			<p>Seth (Hebrew: שֵׁתֿ‎, Biblical Hebrew: Se̞ṭ, Tiberian Šēṯ; Arabic: شِيث‎, translit. Shīth; IPA: [ˈʃiːθ]; "placed; appointed"; Greek: Σήθ), in Judaism, Christianity, Mandaeism, and Islam, was the third son of Adam and Eve and brother of Cain and Abel, who were the only other of their children mentioned by name in the Tanakh (Hebrew Bible). According to Genesis 4:25, Seth was born after Abel's murder, and Eve believed God had appointed him as a replacement for Abel.</p>
			<p>According to Genesis, Seth was born when Adam was 130[1] years old[2] "a son in his likeness and image".[2] The genealogy is repeated at 1 Chronicles 1:1–3. Genesis 5:4–5 states that Adam fathered "sons and daughters" before his death, aged 930 years. According to the Bible, Seth lived to the age of 912.[3]</p>

			<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
	
			<p> Christianity
			</br>
			<p>The 2nd century BC Book of Jubilees, regarded as noncanonical except in the Alexandrian Rite, also dates his birth to 130 AM.[8] According to it, in 231 AM Seth married his sister, Azura, who was four years younger than he was. In the year 235 AM, Azura gave birth to Enos.</p>
			<h4>Seth is commemorated as one of the Holy Forefathers in the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church, along with Adam, Abel, and others, with a feast day on July 26. He is also included in the Genealogy of Jesus, according to Luke 3:23–38.</h4>
			<p>The Sethians were a Christian Gnostic sect who may date their existence to before Christianity.[10] Their influence spread throughout the Mediterranean into the later systems of the Basilideans and the Valentinians.[citation needed] Their thinking, though it is predominantly Judaic in foundation, is arguably strongly influenced by Platonism. Sethians are so called for their veneration of the biblical Seth, who is depicted in their myths of creation as a divine incarnation; consequently, the offspring or 'posterity' of Seth are held to comprise a superior elect within human society.</p>

	
			<h4>Islam
			Although the Qur'an makes no mention of Seth he is revered within Islamic tradition as the third and righteous son of Adam and Eve and seen as the gift bestowed on Adam after the death of Abel. The Sunni scholar and historian ibn Kathir in his Tarikh "History", a.k.a., Al-Bidāya wa-n-nihāya (البداية والنهاية)[11] records that Seth, a prophet like his father Adam, transfers God's Law to mankind after the death of Adam.[12] and places him among the exalted Antediluvian Patriarchs of the Generations of Adam. Some sources say that Seth was the receiver of scriptures.[13] These scriptures are said to be the "first scriptures" mentioned in Q 87:18. Medieval historian and exegete al-Tabari and other scholars say that Seth buried Adam and the secret texts in the tomb of Adam, i.e., the "Cave of Treasures".</h4>
		<p>The Islamic literature holds that Seth was born when Adam was past 100 and that Adam appointed Seth as guide to his people. The eleventh century Syrian historian and translator from Damascus, Abû al-Wafâ Al-Mubashshir ibn Fâtik recorded the maxims and aphorisms of the ancient philosophers in his book Kitâb mukhtâr al-ḥikam wa-maḥâsin al-kalim (مختار الحكم ومحاسن الكلم)[14] and included a chapter on Seth. Within Islamic tradition Seth holds wisdom of several kinds; knowledge of time, prophecy of the future Great Flood, and inspiration on the methods of night prayer. Islam, Judaism and Christianity trace the genealogy of mankind back to Seth since Abel left no heirs and Cain's heirs, according to tradition, were destroyed by the Great Flood. Many traditional Islamic crafts[16] are traced back to Seth, such as the making of horn combs.[17] Seth also plays a role in Sufism, and Ibn Arabi includes a chapter in his 'Bezels of Wisdom' on Seth, titled "The Wisdom of Expiration in the Word of Seth".</p>
		<p>Some traditions locate Seth's tomb in the village of Al-Nabi Shayth (literal meaning "The Prophet Seth") in the mountains above the Baqa’a Valley in Lebanon, where there is a mosque named after him. This tomb was described by the 12th century geographer Ibn Jubayr. A rival tradition, mentioned by later medieval Arab geographers from the 13th century on, placed the tomb of Nabi Shith ("Prophet Seth") in the Palestinian village of Bashshit southwest of Ramla village. According to the Palestine Exploration Fund, Bashshit means Beit Shith, i.e. "House of Seth".[19] The village was depopulated with the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, but the three-domed structure said to be Seth's tomb survives in the Israeli moshav Aseret built on the site.</p>
                        </br>
                <p>Shrine in Mosul</p>
			</br>
			<p>On July 26, 2014, forces of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, blew up Nabi Shiyt (Prophet Seth) shrine in Mosul. Sami al-Massoudi, the deputy head of the Shiite endowment agency overseeing holy sites, confirmed that destruction. He added, ISIL took some of the artifacts to an unknown location.</p>
